Code of the article "Balancing disease spreading and social barter in clustered networks" (add link!!!)

"Generate_graphs.ipynb" generates temporal network with node clustering (Stochastic Block Model ) and temporal clustering.

"Simulate.ipynb" simulates the process of disease spreading (simple SIR model) and of knowledge spreading (threshold contagion model).

"Plot_results.ipynb" aggregates the results of simulations computing averages and errors over the set of runs and plots the temporal evolutions (fig. 2 of the paper).

"Optimal_p.ipynb" plots the figures like figure 3 in the paper.

"Analyze_effective_networks.ipynb" computes and plots the number of links and the value of p in time for the effective networks (i.e. those without links with isolated or quarantined individuals).
